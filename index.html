				<h1>Hello, I'm Hannah :) </h1>
			<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hannah Marotte"  width="100px" class="img-circle">
			<p>
			 	I love travelling (all around the world), fashion, and design. I launched Trip'&'Fash to guide trends' lovers around their trips to new unknown countries. I wanted to share my hobbies, and make something big by mixing both of them.

			<h2>Travels</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about trips. I travel a lot, and I am used to adapt to different people and cultures. I've already been to more than 20 countries !

		<h2>Fashion</h2>
		<p>
			By travelling a lot, I realized I wanted to see more than my own French trends. I then wanted to guide curious people through shops where they could find their perfect clothes.

		<h2>My past career</h2>
		<p>
			I graduated last year, and launched my startup right away. I speak four languages, what helps a lot in the field I'm working in. I'm from France, but I moved to London so that I could express myslef more.
